=head1 NAME

WebService::Minecraft::Fishbans - look for bans for a Minecraft user

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Fishbans|http://www.fishbans.com/> is a service that lets you query various
Minecraft "global ban" systems (e.g. MCBouncer, MCBans, Minebans, etc) in one
API call.

This module is a simple wrapper to query the Fishbans API.  It collates the
bans reported by the Fishbans API, flattening the response to present simply an
array/arrayref of hashrefs, one per recorded ban.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebService::Minecraft::Fishbans;

    my $fishbans = WebService::Minecraft::Fishbans->new();
    if (my @bans = $fishbans->lookup_user($username)) {
        for my $ban (@bans) {
            printf "%s was banned from %s for reason %s (via %s)\n",
                $user, @$ban{ qw(server reason service) };
        }
    }

# Sensible default for our User-Agent object, but allowing it to be replaced
# or modified at runtime if the user requires, or if we want to mock it for
# testing.
has user_agent => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => sub { my $val = shift; ref $val && $val->isa('LWP::UserAgent') },
    default => sub {
        LWP::UserAgent->new( agent => __PACKAGE__ . "/$VERSION" );
    },
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 lookup_user

Given a Minecraft username, queries the Fishbans API and returns a list or
arrayref (depending on context) of hashrefs, each describing a ban.

Each ban hashref will contain:

=over

=item C<server>

The server the user was banned from

=item C<reason>

The reason for the ban, provided by the op who banned them

=item C<service>

The service the ban was found from - e.g. C<mcbouncer>, C<mcbans>, etc.
