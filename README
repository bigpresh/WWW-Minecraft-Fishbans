NAME
    WebService::Minecraft::Fishbans - look for bans for a Minecraft user

DESCRIPTION
    Fishbans is a service that lets you query various Minecraft "global ban"
    systems (e.g. MCBouncer, MCBans, Minebans, etc) in one API call.

    This module is a simple wrapper to query the Fishbans API. It collates
    the bans reported by the Fishbans API, flattening the response to
    present simply an array/arrayref of hashrefs, one per recorded ban.

SYNOPSIS
        use WebService::Minecraft::Fishbans;

        my $fishbans = WebService::Minecraft::Fishbans->new();
        if (my @bans = $fishbans->lookup_user($username)) {
            for my $ban (@bans) {
                printf "%s was banned from %s for reason %s (via %s)\n",
                    $user, @$ban{ qw(server reason service) };
            }
        }

METHODS
  lookup_user
    Given a Minecraft username, queries the Fishbans API and returns a list
    or arrayref (depending on context) of hashrefs, each describing a ban.

    Each ban hashref will contain:

    `server'
        The server the user was banned from

    `reason'
        The reason for the ban, provided by the op who banned them

    `service'
        The service the ban was found from - e.g. `mcbouncer', `mcbans',
        etc.
